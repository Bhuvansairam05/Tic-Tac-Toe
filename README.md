# Tic Tac Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built with React. It provides a 3x3 grid where two players (X and O) take turns marking the cells. The game detects wins, ties, and allows restarting.

## Features

- Built with React and functional components.
- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O).
- Automatic winner detection across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Tie detection when the board is full with no winner.
- Restart button to reset the game at any time.
- Alerts to indicate game results.
